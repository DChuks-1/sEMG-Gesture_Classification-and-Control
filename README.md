# sEMG-Gesture_Classification-and-Control
# sEMG Gesture Control

This project uses surface EMG signals to classify hand gestures.  
It includes signal processing, machine learning models, and hardware control (Arduino-based).

## Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed sEMG data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter or MATLAB notebooks for preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification.
- `src/`: Standalone Python/MATLAB scripts.
- `hardware/`: Arduino code and hardware setup.
- `results/`: Model outputs like confusion matrices and plots.
- `models/`: Trained models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.mat`).
- `literature/`: Reference papers and notes.
- `figures/`: Diagrams for presentation/report.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
